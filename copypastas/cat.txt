"Purr-haps you feel like you've been born the wrong species"
If that sounds like you, we'll introduce a fantastic new product that will let you become a cat at any time,for just-

I couldn't become a cat after all

I couldn't become a cat after all

A surging crowd of people approaches; facinated by leaves
Hiding away somewhere, we let them pass by
Not wanting to catch people's eyes

I wanted to become a purr-fect adult
but the scars from being made into a spectacle added up
I strayed on the path
And before I knew it, I started to break

If you wanna be a cat, put your paws together
Yeah!
If you wanna be a cat, put your paws together
Yeah!

I wanna be you!
Meow, Meow, Meow, let out a yowl, fight and take off running
With the selfishness of a world I never want
to come to know

love and hope, falling seven times;
stumbling, falling eight times
[word play on the phrase 'fall 7 times, stand up 8 times', meaning that one should never give up]
With an innocent look on my face

If it's grown-up talk, leave it somewhere else
Let's search for today's bed and tomorrow's breakfast

I couldn't become a cat after all, huh?
Right~

Pedigree, upbringing,
The list goes on
I crushed that stupid crap of paper under my feet
Shut up, just shut up

In that park, in the pet store
At the other end of the world, no matter the time or place
You're not there
you know there's only one you!

If you wanna be a cat, put your paws together
Yeah!
If you wanna be a cat, put your paws together
Yeah!
I'll do anything, so please!

Meow, Moew, Meow with a meow, roll into a ball and slip inside
The gap on people's slumbering dreams

What a fantastic fairy-tail

I sneakily snatch a bite
Scoldings are out of my area of expertise

In purr-petual sabbatical, no longer accepting offers
Gazing at the gap in a blink
Let's bite back our yawn

I couldn't become a cat after all, huh?

Let's go here
Let's go there
Let's go somewhere my future is waiting
If you're gonna get in my way, you know I won't be able to forgive you
I'll bring out my claws

Just kitten (kidding)

Meow, Meow, Meow, Let out a yowl, fight and take off running
With the selfishness of a world I
never want to come to know
Love and hope, falling seven times;
stumbling, falling eight times
With an innocent look on my face

If it's grown-up talk, leave it somewhere else
Let's search for today's bed and tomorrow's breakfast
And bid farewell to this world

I couldn't become a cat after all, huh?
